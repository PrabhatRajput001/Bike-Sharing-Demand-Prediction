# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction (Machine Learning Regression)
The SEOUL bike sharing demand prediction project aims to predict the hourly bike rental demand for a bike-sharing system in Seoul, South Korea. The dataset used in the project contains hourly data on weather, temperature, humidity, windspeed, and other factors, as well as the corresponding bike rental demand.

The project uses various data preprocessing techniques to clean and transform the data, and several machine learning algorithms are used to build predictive models. These include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, lasso, ridge, and elasticnet.

The project also includes feature engineering techniques to extract additional information from the data, such as creating new variables to capture the effects of weather and time on the bike rental demand.
